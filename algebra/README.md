# 🧮 Algebra

**Fortress Essential Math Lab – Core Mathematics Track**

Algebra is the foundational layer of the Fortress Essential Math Lab.
This module establishes the symbolic reasoning, equation-solving skills, and function concepts required for higher-level mathematics used in quantitative finance, optimization, stochastic modeling, and scientific computing.

The notebooks in this section combine:

* concise conceptual explanations
* symbolic computation using **SymPy**
* numerical experiments using **NumPy / Python**
* worked examples following a structured progression
* references that support future calculus, linear algebra, and probability work

## 📘 Objectives of This Module

The Algebra module is designed to provide:

* A clear and rigorous foundation in symbolic manipulation
* Conceptual understanding of functions, equations, and inequalities
* Practical problem-solving techniques applicable in quantitative modeling
* A reference base for future sections (calculus, linear algebra, probability, statistics)

Even though the structure follows a progression similar to classical algebra curricula, the emphasis here is on **clarity, computation, and practical application** rather than school-style exercises.

## 📓 Notebook Format (What Each Notebook Contains)

Each notebook follows a consistent structure:

### 1. **Concept Overview**

A concise explanation of the topic, written in clear and applied terms.

### 2. **Core Rules & Identities**

Only essential rules — no excessive theory.

### 3. **Manual Example**

A short hand-style solution showing the logical steps
(e.g., expanding, rearranging, solving).

### 4. **Python/SymPy Demonstration**

* symbolic solving
* expression simplification
* checking correctness
* plotting (when relevant)

## 🛠 Tools Used

* **Python**
* **SymPy** – symbolic algebra
* **NumPy / Pandas** – numerical exploration
* **Matplotlib / Plotly (optional)** – visualizing functions
* **Jupyter Notebook** – interactive computation and notes

These tools allow for a computational approach that complements manual reasoning.

## 🎯 Why Algebra Matters in the Fortress Math Lab

Algebra is the backbone of all higher mathematics used in quantitative work:

* linear algebra → vectors, matrices, factor models
* calculus → derivatives, optimization, continuous-time models
* probability → random variables, distributions
* econometrics → regression and functional relationships

A strong algebra base ensures the later sections grow cleanly and systematically.
